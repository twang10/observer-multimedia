Apparently administering hormones directly, rather than referring students out to other clinics, is a new thing for Health Services, but they've taken great care of me. There were a few blips around using the correct name and pronouns for me at the beginning, but not more than other places. I've found that everyone I've worked with one-on-one, nurses, doctors, etc., has been very respectful. I've been <a data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon="to refer to someone using a word, pronoun, or other form of address which does not correctly reflect their gender" data-balloon-pos="up">misgendered</a> mainly in sort of fleeting interactions; for example, when someone who hasn't actually met me is looking at my information.

            My experiences with Health Services has been really positive. Dr. Higham, who I go to for my care, is absolutely amazing and incredibly respectful. I sometimes get misgendered at the reception desk, which is understandable, but once a nurse, during the act of administering my testosterone shot, said “that’s a good girl.” She caught it and apologized afterward, but it was definitely bizarre considering the circumstances.

            My being trans has definitely confused Tufts healthcare professionals. It's just seemed like they'd never dealt with someone in my particular situation before—someone who was medically transitioning but who was vocal about being trans and planning not to go stealth. I can't point to a specific incident, but I've felt in general like my being trans made healthcare professionals more uncertain around me than they would have been around a <a data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon="someone whose gender matches that which they were assigned at birth" data-balloon-pos="up">cisgender</a> person. Fortunately, I haven't had to see them about anything involving my genitals or endocrine system, so it hasn't come up too much. The times I've gone for non-trans stuff, I've often not bothered to mention I was trans—who needs to know your sex assignment to look at a sprained ankle?—and the staff have correctly assumed what my pronouns are based on my appearance.

            I went through Tufts Health Services for the start of my transition several years ago, before we had trans-inclusive health insurance. Margaret Higham was really excellent about strategizing how to work with insurance and get what I needed. She was upfront with me and very respectful of my body and my descriptions of it. I felt like she wasn't reading some checklist of transition milestones, but she was listening to me and letting me determine what I needed.

            I tried going to CMHS when I was considering my transition to work out my thoughts, but the counselor I was assigned to really didn’t seem like she knew much about trans people. What I expected to be an open environment to discuss my thoughts, concerns, and fears was more of an interrogation of my personal background and childhood. I got the vibe that she was more curious about me and my existence than looking to assist me in what I went there for. I attended two sessions before I left and sought an off-campus therapist.

            Counseling is pretty good, at least in my experience, but I’ve only seen one counselor there. She was good, and I didn’t have to worry about names or pronouns while I was there because they had it on the intake sheet.

            I went to therapy through CMHS and also pursued psychiatry through Health Services. I consider those both to be trans-related health care in that I’m a trans person looking for healthcare. Health Services counseling was okay. It didn’t really help me a lot, but I felt that people were caring about how I was doing there. For me, psychiatry at Health Services was a pretty negative experience.  I was looking for medication, and I had never pursued antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication before, so I was going in with no prior information and was really there looking in a crisis moment for me.…I got referred to Susan Mahoney, who’s a psychiatrist at Health Services through my counselor, and she prescribed me a really low dose of antidepressants that I didn’t know was a low dose at the time.…I had appointments set up past the date of my declaration of taking a leave of absence, and when I went to the first of those appointments, I was told that I couldn’t meet with her. I had to push: “This is a scheduled meeting, it’s about important medication.” I had to go through a whole process where they took me off of a leave of absence in Health Services’ records, checked me into the appointment, and then put me back on the leave of absence in their record. It was really frustrating to have that experience. That was the last time I got to see her, and I really wasn't planning for it to be the last time. I saw her and said, “I’m going to be really lost if I stop seeing you,” and her response was “I can’t help you anymore.” So I had to stop seeing her because I was taking a leave of absence.
            <br><br>
            I had a better experience at counseling because my counselor worked hard to get to know me. When it comes to my psychiatrist at Health Services, [the interaction] was very, very shallow, and because it was so shallow, I didn’t want to share vulnerable things with her. I didn’t think she would know how to handle it.

            Before Tufts, I went to a clinic specializing in queer and trans healthcare. There it felt like people "got me" from the moment I walked in, because they were concentrating on serving LGBT patients. Tufts obviously doesn't have that focus, but I do feel well-taken care of.

            I've had a variety of experiences with other healthcare professionals ranging from wonderful to awful. I'd say Tufts is right in the middle—I've never had a Tufts doctor say anything horribly transphobic or make particularly damaging assumptions, but I also don't trust Tufts to know what to do with my complicated body or understand the nuances of my gender, and usually go elsewhere. My general practitioner’s not much better, though—he just sent me to an endocrinologist for high blood pressure primarily because he's so inexperienced with hormone replacement therapy that he farmed me out to a specialist.

            I think it’s a mixed bag. I think there’s some places where I’m less willing to share information about being trans than at Tufts, but at the same time, there’s places where I feel even more comfortable, not necessarily because of [Tufts’] way of handling anything, but just being proactive. I think Tufts is here to help with trans things if you go to them, but if I hadn’t said to use a different name and pronouns they wouldn’t have asked.

            I started going to Fenway, which is LGBT specific, and it’s not perfect, but my primary care is there, and therapy, psychiatry, and other programs are as well. It’s a completely different type of facility than the one that Tufts has, but it’s more <span class="italic">for me</span> than Tufts was. The people there are creating programs and initiating a program of therapy that has someone like me in mind, whereas you can tell Tufts’ Health Services doesn’t seem to have any particular person in mind. They have their idea of what a student at Tufts is in mind, and I don’t know what that includes. Fenway is a larger, better equipped, well-financed kind of clinic, but I get much better care there. I don’t have to explain words or terms to doctors and therapists. There’s a vocabulary block that isn’t there, and that’s a very base level problem that doesn’t need to be there. It’s very solvable, and I feel like I’m getting better care because someone has taken the effort to climb that hill.
            <br><br>
            I wasn’t openly transitioning until my leave of absence, so none of my health care providers knew, and I didn’t want to tell them, because I just didn’t feel that they would know what to do. I was worried that if I had told my counselor that I wanted to transition, every session after that would have been about her idea of what it means to be trans and what problems she <span class="italic">thinks</span> I’m going to have because of that, but right now with my therapist at Fenway, I don’t talk about transitioning that much. It’s a detail about part of the things that we talk about, but it’s also really important that she understands what I’m talking about when I allude to that detail, that I don’t have to explain to her because I don’t need to.

They haven't paid for my hormones, but that's because I get testosterone in a big vial that lasts six months, and BCBS won't pay for more than a month's worth of any hormone regardless of if you're trans or not. Stupid, I know. I hate health insurance companies. If you have any kind of long-term health problem, which I do, you quickly realize what labyrinthine, bureaucratic nightmares they are. Being trans just makes it more of a pain in the ass, although BCBS has been surprisingly good about it. I've spent so many hours on hold that I don't even know who I am anymore.

It seems like that's uncommon across the board, but it still sucks—what everyone wants to do medically varies widely among girls I know, but almost all of us want hair removal. Otherwise, figuring out what is and isn't covered on my own was quite difficult (my doctor helped, actually!). The surgeries I think I want to have done seem to be covered, which is great. That's miles away from actually successfully undergoing surgery with no insurance hassle, though.

            I was on family insurance for part of my time here, but it had a trans-exclusionary clause and I made the switch to Tufts Health Insurance more recently. It’s been incredibly frustrating. That’s the nature of insurance, but switching plans, trying to sort out costs, and finding information on coverage is insanely difficult.

            I have had good experiences at Tufts and at Fenway with healthcare professionals who are clear and strategic about how they mediate between treatment and insurance, so I have not had any problems getting annual pelvic exams, etc. I did pay for hormones out of pocket for a few years, but that was before Tufts got trans-inclusive health insurance. Now, my insurance through the state covers Testopel, which [is a series of] little slow-release pellets inserted under my skin.

            I had some trouble when I enrolled because I hadn't changed my legal name yet, but didn't want my email address to reflect my legal name. After a week of irritable emails, they changed my name and email address in the system.

            I applied to Tufts under my <a data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon="a name a trans person no longer uses but was assigned at birth" data-balloon-pos="up">dead name</a>, and emailed my graduate director in August like "…soooo I'm a girl…" and she emailed back very quickly and was very supportive. She put me in touch with Nino Testa at the LGBT center who was a great person to go to and complain about things like "I can't fix my email address, what is happening?” Since I can put my real name in the "preferred name" slot on Trunk/SIS, I almost never have to interact with my legal name, which is great. I wish it were never, but I'm planning on changing my name this year. The faculty in my department, upon hearing they'd have two incoming trans grad students, did a workshop on pronouns with the LGBT Center, and I've felt supported during my time here.

            It’s been really positive. Changing my email address and everything involving names has been smooth. Nino Testa, who’s the director of the LGBT Center, is an amazing resource and a stellar individual; he’s helped me personally through each of the steps I’ve taken so far, and has really gone out of his way to help me find the information I need and assist me in any way that he can. The administration in general has been really accommodating.

            Most admin folks I interacted with during transition are no longer at Tufts. I think certain current administrators (Mary Pat McMahon, Nino Testa, and others) are much more conversant in trans-inclusive language than others I have interacted with.

            Considering how hard it is to find employment as a trans person, I think that needs to be something that career services has a focus on because these are the students who are going to have the hardest time finding a job along with lots of other marginalized people, but that was never provided for me.

            I’ve had an incredibly irritating time dealing with housing. Housing usually just sticks you in a single because they don’t know what else to do with you, which I feel like sums up Tufts re: trans (especially non-binary) students—they just don’t know what to do with you. Housing gave me a single my first year, which was great, but my second year me and some trans and cisgender queer friends tried to get a Latin Way suite through gender neutral housing. Yolanda King told us we didn’t have good enough lottery numbers, and it took a number of conversations with Nino at the LGBT Center [who advocated to Res Life] and an email basically saying 'we will tell everyone you discriminated against trans students if you don't give us the suite' to get us a place to live together.

            Tufts is slightly better than average, but that’s not saying much. It’s better to binary students than non-binary students, for sure. Everything from housing to your medical files lists you as M or F. Some Tufts employees seem confused by <a data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon="pronouns which are not associated with being specifically male or female, for example, they/them/theirs and ze/hir/hirs" data-balloon-pos="up">gender neutral pronouns</a>, and even the ones who are familiar with them don’t always seem like they actually know much of anything about non-binary people.
            <br><br>
            I’m glad to see that administration is working on bathrooms and housing, but I wish they’d also train teachers better. All faculty should know what a pronoun is and what some of the more common ones are; all faculty should know they have to use the name a student asks to be called even if it doesn't match the roster; all faculty should know not to doubt a student's self-identification. I've had some very bad times with teachers about being trans.
            <br><br>
            I had an issue with my English 1 teacher. I outed myself to share a personal experience about <a data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon="also known as “egg freezing,” a process where ovum are extracted and saved—a common precautionary measure as many individuals undergoing masculinizing hormone therapy face fertility concerns" data-balloon-pos="up">egg banking</a> during a class discussion, and from then on she could not get my pronouns right to save her life. It got to the point that other students in the class would be correcting her all the time because she would call me "she" or "her" so often. I wound up giving her homework (sending her articles, asking her to practice using the right pronouns by writing about me in the third person), but it didn't really help. It made the class so uncomfortable that I would have dropped it if it wasn't mandatory. She also seemed really confused that I considered myself fat (I weigh 250…pretty sure that counts) and that I didn't feel particularly bad about it, so we must not have been on the same page about a lot of things.

            My experience with parts of Tufts (Health Services, the LGBT Center, the Women's Center) have been fantastic. But the Tufts Alumni Association (I'm a double Jumbo) has persisted in sending me misgendered and mis-named mail, which leads me to believe they take their data from a database that is not updated if a student changes their name/gender marker while they are at Tufts. Why do we gender people on their alumni mailings in the first place? I think this reflects a lack of critical thinking at high levels. And frankly, the alumni mailing example is a little scary. What if I wasn't out to my neighbors and they got my mail addressed to "Ms." me? I have moved several times since graduating the first time and it feels like my old name has followed me around, under the auspices of Tufts Alumni. I don't know if it seems like a trivial example, but every time I get mail from them I feel angry and weird.

            Places like the library and Dewick are not prepared for trans students. All of these places are not set up to accommodate trans students correctly because the people who control these different systems aren’t setting them up to be that way.…The fact that I couldn’t go to the bathroom in basically any campus building is incredibly inappropriate. I couldn’t use the Campus Center because what if I had to pee? In Tisch, I would have to walk from the basement, upstairs, across to where the reading room is to use the single bathrooms there, and the whole way I’m thinking, “Wow, nobody really wants me to be able to pee.” They’re making it really hard for me.

            I have a herniated L4-5 spinal disc with sciatica, which means chronic pain and some difficulty walking, especially on an incline. Managing care for the herniated disc and being trans at the same time has meant I've had to time things precisely—I wanted top surgery over summer break last year, but my back was also really bad, so I had to do physical therapy for the first half of the summer in preparation for getting surgery in the second half, because I wouldn't be able to do PT during surgical recovery, and my disc was liable to get a lot worse. My doctors (GP, ortho, surgeon, and recently a new endocrinologist) all had to and still have to be kept up to date on what's happening with my back and my medical transition. So much happens that it's hard to keep everyone in the loop, but it can be dangerous for them not to know my entire medical history. Plus, I have to go through the whole, "Wait you're trans? When and how did you first know? Tell me personal and potentially upsetting things that aren't necessarily relevant to the condition I'm treating," thing every time I see someone new.

            It wasn't until my junior year that anyone talked about the fact that there might be any trans students at Tufts. I spent two years not even knowing that there were any trans students at Tufts, which sucked.

I know Nino does a lot of work to include trans students, or maybe that’s not the vocabulary they use, but…there have been specific things where I’ve felt like, “Okay, this is about trans people,” like I went to a meeting about gender-neutral bathrooms, but in general I feel like the types of things that the LGBT Center does do not constitute the level and gravity of support that trans students really need, and maybe it’s just not able to do that.…I don’t know that any of the things it does are wrong, but I don’t think that enough is done, and maybe it’s unfair to place that all on the LGBT Center, but it’s just not everything that it needs to be.…I know it’s something that people have been trying to work on for a long time at the LGBT Center—the whole time I’ve been at Tufts it’s been a discussion of “how can we make this better?”

            The LGBT Center offers a variety of resources for trans and non-binary students. Some of these are direct support resources—like T-Time, our student-only discussion group for trans, non-binary and gender questioning students, and our other student discussion groups; one-on-one support with LGBT Center staff; and printed resource materials on health concerns for trans students. Other resources are really social and educational opportunities for trans students to connect with each other and invited guests. The third kind of resource we offer is one that may not be as visible to students, and that is the workshops that we facilitate for faculty, staff, and student groups. We’ve made a lot of progress training the Tufts community not just on the basics of gender identity and expression, but on the importance of <a data-balloon-length="medium" data-balloon="fluency and knowledge regarding asking for people’s pronouns and using them properly" data-balloon-pos="up">pronoun fluency</a>.…We have made an incredible amount of progress…in the past year and a half. Thanks to our partners in ResLife, next year, rooms for upperclass students will not be designated as “M” or “F,” making gender-neutral housing options accessible to all students. We also started asking first-year students if they would like to be placed in gender-neutral housing last year. Our colleagues at Tufts Technology Services have been hard at work building pronoun fields and improved name change capabilities for SIS, Tufts e-mail, White Pages, and other University services. Next year, Admissions will ask applicants to Tufts to describe their gender in more nuanced, and inclusive ways, and under the leadership of Dr. Margaret Higham at Health Service, we are working on a focus group for trans students to talk about their visits to Health Service so that we can work to improve their experiences.
            <br><br>
            For me, the most important thing about our Health Service staff is that they want to get it right.… We can talk about the specifics of best practices—how to do intake, how to label people’s files in relation to gender identity, how to develop the necessary skill set to be able to start a patient on hormone replacement therapy—but more important than any one specific thing that Health Service is doing right or wrong at the moment is their authentic and consistent desire to improve their services for trans students. I talk with colleagues at other institutions who have to fight with their Health Service staff to get this on their radar at all. Tufts Health Service calls me up and says, “This is what we have done. This is what we are working on. How can we get better?” I think we are lucky to have professionals with that kind of attitude.
            <br><br>
            As numbers of trans and non-binary students at Tufts continue to grow, I want Tufts to continue asking difficult questions about what it means to create spaces that aren’t just “inclusive” of these students but that are also equitable. Sometimes that means re-thinking resources, practices, and structures that have been in place for as long as Tufts has been around. We have made a lot of progress in recent years, but we have much more work to do, and I am excited to do this work with student, staff, and faculty partners across campus.
